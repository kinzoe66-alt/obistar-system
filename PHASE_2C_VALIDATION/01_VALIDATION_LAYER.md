# VALIDATION LAYER — PHASE 2C

## PURPOSE
No decisions are made here.
No actions are taken here.
This layer only validates coherence of the system state.

---

## WHAT IS VALIDATED
- Schema consistency across all internal surfaces
- Invariant preservation across phases
- Ledger completeness and continuity
- Explicitness of all state transitions
- Absence of hidden or implicit execution paths

---

## PASS CRITERIA
This layer passes if:
- All prior phases are internally consistent
- Every transition is ledgered
- System state can be explained in under 30 seconds
- No execution capability exists at this layer
