# VALIDATION LAYER — PHASE 2C

## PURPOSE
No decisions are made here.
No actions are taken here.

---

## WHAT IS VALIDATED
- Schema consistency across all internal surfaces
- Invariant preservation across phases
- Ledger completeness and continuity
- Explicitness of all state transitions
- Absence of hidden or implicit execution paths

---

If the system state cannot be explained clearly,
it is not valid.
