# VALIDATION OVERVIEW — PHASE 2C

## PURPOSE
Confirm that the system is internally coherent, invariant-preserving,
and fully explainable without executing actions.

No decisions are made here.
No actions are taken here.

---

## VALIDATION CHECKS
- Schema consistency across all internal surfaces
- Invariant preservation across phases
- Ledger completeness and continuity
- Explicitness of all state transitions
- Absence of hidden or implicit execution paths

---

## PASS CONDITION
The full system state can be explained clearly,
deterministically, and completely in under 30 seconds.
