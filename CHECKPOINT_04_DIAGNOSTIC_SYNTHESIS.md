# OBISTAR — CHECKPOINT 04

## Diagnostic → Synthesis Flow Declaration

This checkpoint formalizes how information moves without execution.

### Diagnostic Layer
- Observes environments
- Classifies behavior under constraint
- Emits PRUC-evaluated signals
- Holds no authority to act

### Synthesis Layer
- Receives diagnostic signals
- Forms descriptive objects only
- No prioritization
- No recommendation
- No execution

### Authorized Outputs
- Opportunity Objects
- Alignment Gap Objects

### Authority Boundary
Diagnostic and synthesis terminate before action.
No function may cross into execution space.

Status: ACTIVE
Flow: LOCKED
