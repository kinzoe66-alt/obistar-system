# OBISTAR — CHECKPOINT 06

## Diagnostic Card Wiring

This checkpoint binds diagnostic signals to the SDOM card
without introducing direction, priority, or execution.

### Card Structure

Each Diagnostic Card exposes:

### 1. Current Environment State
- Classification label
- Constraint density
- Stability posture (stable / transitional / unstable)

### 2. Core Meta-Metrics (Time-Series)
These are observed, not optimized.

- Pattern Reinforcement (PRUC)
- Constraint Pressure
- Variance Direction
- Recovery Signal
- Signal Consistency

Metrics are expressed as:
- Rising
- Flat
- Falling

### 3. Temporal Interpretation Layer
- Rising ≠ success
- Falling ≠ failure
- Flat ≠ stagnation

Change indicates **attention shift**, not action.

### 4. Forecast Window (Non-Predictive)
The system may state:
- “If reinforcement continues…”
- “If pressure increases…”
- “If recovery degrades…”

These are **conditional descriptions**, not outcomes.

### 5. Authority Termination
- No recommendation
- No prioritization
- No next step
- No action surface

Authority always terminates at observation.

### Human Role
Humans interpret cards across time.
Meaning emerges through comparison, not instruction.

Status: ACTIVE  
Diagnostics: WIRED  
Execution: TERMINATED
