# OBISTAR — CHECKPOINT 05

## Expression Surface Declaration (SDOM)

This checkpoint defines how internal structure becomes visible
without granting authority or execution.

### Purpose
- Make system state observable
- Preserve diagnostic neutrality
- Enable human interpretation

### Expression Principles
- Read-only
- Descriptive
- Time-aware
- Non-directive

### Core Expression Unit: SDOM Card

Each SDOM Card contains:

1. Environment State
   - Current classification
   - Stability signal (PRUC-informed)

2. Active Signals (Meta-metrics)
   - Reinforcement trends
   - Constraint pressure indicators
   - Variance direction (up / flat / down)

3. Interpretive Notes
   - What is strengthening
   - What is degrading
   - What remains neutral

4. Authority Boundary
   - No recommendation
   - No instruction
   - No execution

### Temporal Behavior
- Signals update over time
- Meaning emerges through motion, not snapshots
- Flat is acceptable
- Degradation is informative, not failure

### Human Role
Humans observe patterns and decide.
OBISTAR never acts.

Status: ACTIVE
Surface: READ-ONLY
Execution: TERMINATED
