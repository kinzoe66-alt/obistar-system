# OBISTAR — CHECKPOINT 09

## Time Axis & State Evolution

This checkpoint formalizes time as an observable dimension
within diagnostic expression.

### Time Model
- Discrete snapshots
- Ordered sequence
- No real-time enforcement
- No prediction authority

### Card State Over Time

Each Diagnostic Card may expose:

T0 — Initial Observation  
T1 — Reinforcement Change  
T2 — Pressure Shift  
T3 — Recovery / Degradation  

Time steps are descriptive only.
They do not imply causality or outcome.

### Temporal Rendering Rules
- Change is shown relative to previous state
- No alerts
- No urgency
- No thresholds

### Meta-Metric Motion
- ↑ indicates increasing signal strength
- → indicates persistence
- ↓ indicates degradation

Motion informs attention, not action.

### Authority Boundary
Time does not grant authority.
Change does not imply instruction.

Status: ACTIVE  
Time Axis: ENABLED
