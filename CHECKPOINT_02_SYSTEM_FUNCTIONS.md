# OBISTAR — CHECKPOINT 02

## System Functions Declaration

OBISTAR exposes diagnostic structure only.
OBISTAR does not act, execute, recommend, or optimize.

### Core System Functions (Read-Only)

1. Environment Classification  
   - Identifies environment type  
   - Detects constraint presence  
   - Observes behavioral stability or drift  

2. Pattern Reinforcement Under Constraint (PRUC)  
   - Tracks pattern persistence  
   - Notes reinforcement, degradation, or variance  
   - Never converts signals into action  

3. Diagnostic State Rendering  
   - Presents current environment state  
   - Displays structural stability indicators  
   - Shows what the system is observing, not deciding  

4. Meta-Metric Awareness  
   - Tracks signals the system watches over time  
   - Indicates which metrics are gaining or losing relevance  
   - No thresholds, no alerts, no triggers

### Explicit Non-Functions

- No execution  
- No prioritization  
- No forecasting outcomes  
- No recommendations  
- No autonomous decisions  
- No external control  

Authority terminates before action.
